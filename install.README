Installation instruction for BARREL SOC.
rev131016

NOTE: These instructions are written assuming you have a clean install of 
Ubuntu Server LTS with a LAMP stack and Open SSH Server.

1. Install Git:
   $ sudo apt-get install git

2. Download the current SOC package:
   $ git clone https://github.com/barrelballoons/barrel-soc.git

   This will create a folder called "barrel-soc" in the current directory.
   It can be deleted when the installation is complete.

3. Move to the "soc-package directory":
   $ cd barrel-soc/soc-package

4. Copy the web files over:
   $ sudo cp -r var/ /

5. The make the web apps executable.
   $ sudo chmod -R a+x /var/www/cgi-bin/

6. Take ownership of all of the web files:
   $ sudo chown -R [USER]:[GROUP] /var/www/
   Where [USER] and [GROUP] are set to whoever owns the mainance account. 
   Typical setup is for "barrel:barrel".

7. Setup the web server by copying over the configuration files:
   $ sudo cp -r systemFiles/* /etc/apache2/

8. Restart the web server so the changes will take effect:
   $ sudo service apache2 restart

9. Create the mount points for the SOC and MOC NAS's:
   $ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/moc-nas
   $ sudo mkdir /mnt/soc-nas

   NOTE: This step is needed regardless of whether or not you intent to use a 
      NAS. This points to where all of the data files will be stored. 
      If you would like to use another location, it can be specified in 
      /var/www/cgi-bin/SOC_conf.pm .

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: 
   If you are not using a NAS, skip to step 12.


11. Install cifs utils for NAS communication:
   $ sudo apt-get install cifs-utils

10. Add NAS configuration to your /etc/fstab.
   
   The following line needs to be added to fstab for each NAS you are attaching:
   //[IP]/[SHARE] [MOUNT_POINT] cifs username=[USER],password=[PASS],noperm 0 0

   [IP]: the network address of the NAS (e.g. 192.168.1.100).
   [SHARE]: The folder on the NAS that is shared.
   [MOUNT_POINT]: The folder on the SOC that will host the remote files.
      (Once line should be /mnt/soc-nas and the other should be /mnt/moc-nas 
      if you are using two NAS's and the default directories).
   [USER]/[PASS]: The user name and password you have configured on each NAS/

   The file can easily be edited on the command line with the following command:
   $ sudo pico /etc/fstab

11. Mount the new drives:
   $ sudo mount [MOUNT_POINT]

   This command should be run for each mount point set in fstab. It should not 
   give any dialog response.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12. Copy the shared data files to the MOC/SOC NAS:
   $ sudo cp -r mnt/ /

   NOTE: This command will need to be altered if you are not storing these files
      in the default /mnt/soc-nas and /mnt/moc-nas.

13. Create payload directories in /mnt/soc-nas:
   $ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/soc-nas/payload[XX]/raw
   
   [XX]: Payload identifier (e.g. 1A)

   This command must be run for every payload from which data will be collected.

14. Give everyone read and write premissions and take ownership of the 
   shared files (Uses typical/default settings):
   $ sudo chmod -R a+rw /mnt/moc-nas/
   $ sudo chmod -R a+rw /mnt/soc-nas/

   $ sudo chown -R barrel:barrel /mnt/moc-nas/
   $ sudo chown -R barrel:barrel /mnt/soc-nas/

15. Create a symbolic link from the SOC-NAS to the webserver:
   $ sudo ln -s  /mnt/soc-nas/ /var/www/html/soc-nas

16. Edit the availible payload list:
   $ sudo nano /var/www/cgi-bin/SOC_conf.pm

   Edit the payload list on line 7 and the list starting on line 400.
